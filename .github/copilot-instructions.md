Be mindful of unnecessarily usage of loop where not needed. Prefer event-driven approaches when possible.

The use of pcall should be avoided,  pcalls are not the solution for bad code. Most times there are better solutions that are cleaner, and more performant (even if by not much). Pcalls should only be used for datastores, web API calls, and similar.
