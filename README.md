# 🌍 Game Overview

A life-simulation game that blends **BitLife-style choices** with **The Sims-style building**.  
The player does not directly control NPCs moment-to-moment. Instead, they **manage a plot of land** and place items (bed, stove, fridge, books, etc.).  
These items shape how NPCs live, what jobs they can get, and ultimately their life outcomes.  

The **house shell** is the main progression system:  

- Starts as a shack.  
- Expands with upgrades.  
- Provides more buildable space as it grows.  

The player’s core loop is:  
**Place items → NPCs survive → NPC stats grow → NPCs get jobs → Earn coins → Upgrade house → Unlock more items → Repeat.**

Players can also **intervene directly** using the **Direct Action System** — selecting NPCs and telling them to *Eat*, *Sleep*, *Study*, etc. This adds a proactive layer to shaping each life.

## 🌱 Early Game

### Starting State

- Empty plot with a small shack shell (Tier 0).  
- 1 NPC (“First Life”) with basic stats.  
- Starter items: sleeping bag, cooler.  
- ~500 coins.  

### Player Goals

- Keep NPC alive (manage Hunger + Energy).  
- Place first survival items (stove, fridge, bed).  
- Learn the build/placement system.  
- Learn the **Direct Action System**:  
  - Manually tell NPCs to eat or sleep when motives get low.  
  - Prevent early deaths through babysitting.  

### Player Feeling

- Scarcity and survival pressure.  
- “I’m poor and struggling, but I can scrape by if I manage carefully.”  
- Hands-on micromanagement builds attachment to the first NPC.

## 🌿 Mid Game

### Mid Game Progression

- Upgrade house shell to Tier 1 → Tier 2 (small house → family home).  
- Unlock more buildable grid space.  
- Add more NPCs (family, roommates, new lives).  
- NPCs qualify for better jobs (clerk, tech, nurse).  
- Stats begin diverging: some NPCs thrive, others fall behind.  

### Gameplay Depth

- Players juggle multiple NPCs and their needs.  
- Placement strategy matters: shower to avoid hygiene penalties, desk for studying.  
- **Direct Action System** shifts role:  
  - Less about babysitting, more about scheduling (“Study now” before school).  
  - Strategic interventions accelerate stat growth.  

### Mid Game Player Feeling

- Growth and discovery.  
- “I’m building a real home and shaping multiple lives.”  
- Balance between letting NPCs act autonomously and stepping in at key moments.

## 🌳 Late Game

### Late Game Progression

- Upgrade house shell to Tier 3 (villa) → max grid space.  
- Support 4–6 NPCs simultaneously.  
- Unlock high-end items (gym, advanced computer, luxury kitchen).  
- NPCs achieve top-tier jobs (doctor, engineer, musician).  
- Coins flow steadily → player decorates and experiments.  

### Endgame Loop

- Balancing multiple lives with diverging outcomes.  
- Building the “ultimate household” with every motive covered.  
- Optional prestige/rebirth system: retire NPCs, start new generations, inherit stats/wealth.  
- **Direct Action System** at this stage:  
  - Used for fine-tuning outcomes (e.g., train one NPC into a superstar doctor).  
  - Strategic choice of who to push and who to leave autonomous.  

### Late Game Player Feeling

- Legacy, attachment, and pride.  
- “I started with nothing and now have a thriving household.”  
- Each NPC life tells a story shaped partly by the environment and partly by player intervention.  

### ⚰️ NPC Life Cycle

- NPCs age: Child → Teen → Adult → Elder → Death.  
- Aging creates urgency and legacy.  
- Children inherit traits and carry the story forward.  
- Direct Action adds drama — the player may push a child to study harder or care for an elder more closely.  
- Memorial system can log past NPCs to give a sense of history.
